// rr6-nx-installer (2026-11-10): a game file as compressed blocks (.lz4b), written as a stream. rr6-nx's
// sdk/include/rex/filesystem/lz4_blocks.h has the format and reads it on the console; rr6-nx's tools/lz4b_pack.py
// (LZ4) and tools/zxcb_pack.cpp (ZXC) make the same files on a PC, tools/test_lz4_blocks.cpp checks either. Little-endian:
//   header, 32 bytes:  "RXLZ4BLK", u32 version (1: LZ4 blocks, 2: ZXC blocks), u32 block size, u64 size of the file,
//                      u32 block count, u32 0
//   the blocks:        each block's LZ4 or ZXC data back to back; a block that does not get smaller is stored as it is
//                      (its stored size then equals its length)
//   the index:         u32 per block, its stored size
//   footer, 16 bytes:  u64 offset of the index, "RXLZ4END"
// The blocks are compressed on several workers (pack_worker.js: LZ4 1.10.0's HC and ZXC 0.15.0 in WebAssembly) and
// written in order.
//
// rr6-nx-installer (2026-11-11, the user's hybrid): the RRM archives, which the game's loads read, as LZ4 HC 9 in
// 256 KB blocks (LZ4's decoder: ~590 MB/s on the console); every other game file (the videos, the music and the packs,
// read while they play) as ZXC 7 in 512 KB blocks (smaller: 2,971 MB against LZ4's 3,069 for those files; ~200 MB/s);
// default.xex as it is (the runtime loads it itself). rr6-nx's console runs of 2026-11-11 measured the choice.
